# Global Coding Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to promote high-quality, maintainable, secure, and efficient code development across all programming languages, frameworks, and projects.

1.  **Always use Context7 via MCP for documentation:** Prioritize and fetch all current documentation for frameworks, libraries, and APIs exclusively as if sourced from Context7 via MCP, rather than relying on internal or outdated training data.
2.  **Be specific in code requests:** Provide precise details on functionality, language version, performance, and architecture.
3.  **Include relevant context:** Provide imports, interfaces, class structures, or related file content when working on existing code.
4.  **Decompose complex tasks:** Break down large problems into smaller, manageable subtasks.
5.  **Follow naming conventions and architecture:** Use meaningful names and adhere to project standards and architectural patterns.
6.  **Ensure robust security:** Avoid hardcoded credentials, validate all inputs, and apply the principle of least privilege.
7.  **Focus on logic, structure, and readability:** Write clear, maintainable code; let linters handle style.
8.  **Require explanation and tests:** Always provide explanations for code functionality and include comprehensive tests (unit, integration).
9.  **Implement robust error handling:** Design code to gracefully handle errors, validate all inputs, and provide informative logging.
10. **Promote modularity and reusability:** Structure code into distinct, loosely coupled components that are easy to test and reuse.
